                    The Gospel of Jesus Christ is eternal, so its been around for a very long time. God, our Heavenly Father, loves us very much, and we wanted to become like him, so we decided long ago to come to earth and be born to earthly parents and live a life where we could choose to be happy. However, there was much tradegy in this world, so God sent his Son, Jesus Christ, (our spiritual elder brother and Savior) to come and redeem us. While he was Here HE spread his Gospel. A set of standards and doctrine that would help us throguh this life and give us purpose and meaning, so that we could all be happy and return to live with God again after we die.
