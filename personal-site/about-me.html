                <p>My name is Benjamin Brinkerhoff, but soon, I'll go by Elder Brinkerhoff and will become a representative of Jesus Christ spreading and informing others (if they are willing) about the restored Gospel of our Redeemer Jesus Christ! He is an infinitely loving God, and wants the best for all of us. Because I have seen his love and it's positive impact throughout my entire life I decided to sacrifice two whole years of my personal life to spread his wonderful message of unity, peace, salvation, and most importantly of Jesus Christ's everlasting love!</p>
