      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To supply a small news outlet of my Church Mission. Instead of having a weekly email, I would like to have a website whereI can refer people for basic contact info as a missionary and have some mini-textual answers to general gospel questions like a Q&A.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is going to my family and friends from home, which ranges for all ranges, so I want to make this website as user-friendly as possible. MY Ausdience will want one place that they can go to in order to get updates from my mission, a basic reference guide (like a Q&A) for how I've been teaching the Gospel, and a gallery page for all my photos</p>  <!-- change this -->

        [Follow Elder Brinkerhoff spread Jesus Christ's Gospel!

        The Gospel of Jesus Christ is eternal, so its been around for a very long time. God, our Heavenly Father, loves us very much, and we wanted to become like him, so we decided long ago to come to earth and be born to earthly parents and live a life where we could choose to be happy. However, there was much tradegy in this world, so God sent his Son, Jesus Christ, (our spiritual elder brother and Savior) to come and redeem us. While he was Here HE spread his Gospel. A set of standards and doctrine that would help us throguh this life and give us purpose and meaning, so that we could all be happy and return to live with God again after we die.]

      <p>
        [My name is Benjamin Brinkerhoff, but soon, I'll go by Elder Brinkerhoff and will become a representative of Jesus Christ spreading and informing others (if they are willing) about the restored Gospel of our Redeemer Jesus Christ!
