        Hello! My name is Benjamin Brinkerhoff and I have submitted my Missionary Service Application for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, however my application was put on pause, with the request from the church authorites, real prophets seers and revalators, to perform some additional requested mental health assignments... So here I am at another semester at BYU-I! I am in my College Sophmore year, and I'm studying Computer Science, alshotugh I might switch to Software enginerring because that is the specific job I want when I graduate. One of my biggest life goals is to get sealed/married in the temple before I get my bachelors degree and to raise a great family!
        I know, typical member-stuff...but the celestial kingdom isn't that far away folks!
